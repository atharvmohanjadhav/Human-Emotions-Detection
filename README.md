# Human-Emotions-Detection ðŸ˜Š

# **Overview**

Human Emotions Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is a project designed to identify human emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, etc., based on facial expressions. This repository contains the code, dataset, and instructions to build, train, and test a CNN model for emotion classification.

# **Features**

Preprocessed dataset with facial expressions labeled for different emotions.

A CNN model built using Python and TensorFlow/Keras.

Model training, validation, and testing scripts.

Real-time emotion detection using webcam (optional).

Visualization of training metrics and model predictions.

# **Technologies Used**

Python

TensorFlow/Keras

OpenCV (for real-time detection)

Matplotlib (for visualizations)

Numpy & Pandas (for data processing)
